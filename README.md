### ⚠️ It is highly recommended that you *do not* use these plate files with an aftermarket Filco Majestouch 2 TKL PCB, other than specifically [Phantom TKL](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Phantom) compatible PCBs, as there is *zero* guarantee that such PCBs will be compatible with this plate, or other Phantom TKL derived plate files, due to differences in switch/clustre spacing and or stabilizer orientation ⚠️

# What is this?
These are modified [Phantom TKL keyboard plate files](https://github.com/mohitg11/GH-CAD-Resources) with a *completely fixed* layout, and a controller cutout that makes these compatible with OEM Filco Majestouch 2 TKL PCBs.  
***Only compatible with all south-facing & plate-mounted Cherry-style stabilizers, and the default US-ANSI Majestouch 2 TKL keyboard layout.***
