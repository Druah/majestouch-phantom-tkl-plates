# What is this?
These are modified [Phantom TKL keyboard plate files](https://github.com/mohitg11/GH-CAD-Resources) with a *completely fixed* layout, and a controller cutout that makes these compatible with OEM Filco Majestouch 2 TKL PCBs  

## Compatibility
- OEM Filco Majestouch 2 TKL PCBs (tested, confirmed to work, see below) or [Phantom TKL](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Phantom) footprint PCBs
> [!WARNING]
> I cannot be held liable if you use any other PCB that doesn't meet these above criteria and something doesn't work
- US-ANSI layout with 6.25U bottom row
- All south-facing Cherry-style plate mount stabilizers
